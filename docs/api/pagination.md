# Pagination

This document provides detailed information on how to use pagination in API requests for listing resources such as trainings, billing profiles, invoices, and more.

Pagination helps in managing large datasets by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable chunks.

## Query Parameters

The pagination is controlled by two query parameters:

- **`limit`**: The number of items to return in a single request. Default is `20`.
- **`offset`**: The number of items to skip before starting to collect the result set. Default is `0`, meaning no items are skipped at the start.

### Example Request

```
GET /v1/trainings?limit=20&offset=0
```

This request fetches the first 20 training records.

## Response Headers

The API response includes several headers to provide information about the pagination and total number of items available:

- **`x-Total`**: The total number of items available.
- **`x-Limit`**: The limit specified in the request, or the default limit if not specified.
- **`x-Offset`**: The offset specified in the request, or the default offset if not specified.

### Example Response Headers

```
x-Total: 100
x-Limit: 20
x-Offset: 0
```

## Link Header

The `Link` header provides relative links to navigate between pages. It includes links for the first, previous, next, and last pages. Note that the `prev` and `next` links may not exist if you are on the first or last page, respectively.

### Example Link Header

```
Link: </v1/trainings?limit=20&offset=0>; rel="first",
      </v1/trainings?limit=20&offset=20>; rel="prev"
      </v1/trainings?limit=20&offset=40>; rel="next",
      </v1/trainings?limit=20&offset=80>; rel="last"
```

In this example:
- The `first` link points to the first page of the results.
- The `prev` link points to the previous page of the results.
- The `next` link points to the next page of the results.
- The `last` link points to the last page of the results.

## Handling Empty Links

When navigating through the pages:
- The `prev` link will be missing if you are on the first page.
- The `next` link will be missing if you are on the last page.

### Example of non existing Links

On the first page:
```
Link: </api/trainings?limit=20&offset=0>; rel="first",
      </api/trainings?limit=20&offset=20>; rel="next",
      </api/trainings?limit=20&offset=80>; rel="last"
```

On the last page:
```
Link: </api/trainings?limit=20&offset=0>; rel="first",
      </api/trainings?limit=20&offset=60>; rel="prev",
      </api/trainings?limit=20&offset=80>; rel="last"
```

## Summary

Pagination in the API is designed to efficiently manage large datasets by breaking them into smaller pages. Utilize the `limit` and `offset` query parameters to control the pagination, and refer to the response headers for navigation and total item information. The `Link` header provides easy navigation between pages, ensuring a smooth experience when dealing with large datasets.
